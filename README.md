# LunchBuddy

<img src="public/img/logo.png">

## Description
We built an app to encouraging people from the same company to go out to each together. The user has access to view dynamically generate lunch group cards which give them all the information they need so if they want or are available to join the group. You can also create your own lunch group.

## Inspiration
We created this app tp help create new friendships and/or finding people who enjoy the same food as you, like being vegan within the same company.
